<h1 style="text-align: center; font-size:2em">Be careful with the misleading charts and infographic</h1>
<p style="text-align: center;">Nowadays, people rely on pictures, visualized information very much.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">However, we should always be critical and awareness in order to avoid misleading information.</p>

<h2 style=" font-size:1.5em">Example 1 : Check the Y-axis</h2>
<img src="ex1.png">
<p>The Y-axis number in the left picture is from 3.140% as a starting point, and is adjusted by every 0.002%. </p>
        <p>This showed that the interest rate is climbing so fast. However, the Y-axis in the right one starts from 0 and increases upwards by 0.5%. </p>
                <p>In this way, the annual interest rate looks stable.</p>

           



<h3 style=" font-size:1.5em">Example 2 : The sum of the pie charts is not 100?</h2>
    

    <p>If the sum of the pie charts is not 100, the pie chart cannot be considered as a whole.</p>
    <p>When the scale of the pie chart is problematic then the information would be misleading.</p>

    <img src="ex2.jpg">

    <p>This figure is a survey of people's opinion on the future career, there are three options, but how to interpret them into 73%, 69%, 46%?</p>
    <p>This is actually a very odd result. The pie chart is not completed. The sum of the three numbers is not equal to 100%. It is meaningless to compare the numbers with each other.</p>
